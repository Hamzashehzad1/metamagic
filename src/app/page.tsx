                  Yes, MetaMagic is completely free to use. We don't charge any subscription fees. The only cost is from your own Google Gemini API key usage. You have full control over your API key and can set quotas and monitor usage directly in your Google AI Studio account.

                  Absolutely. Your credentials are encrypted and stored securely in a Firestore database that only you can access. We use Firebase's robust security rules to ensure that your data is private and linked exclusively to your authenticated account.

                  MetaMagic is powered by Google's state-of-the-art Gemini family of models. We use different models for different tasksâ€”like Gemini 2.5 Flash for its speed in text generation and Gemini Pro Vision for its powerful image analysis capabilitiesâ€”to ensure the highest quality results.

                  Not at all! MetaMagic is designed for everyoneâ€”from professional SEOs to bloggers, photographers, and small business owners. Our tools automate the best practices, so you can achieve expert-level results without the steep learning curve.

                  An Application Password is a special password you can create in your WordPress user profile. It allows applications like MetaMagic to connect to your site securely without you having to use your main password. It's a standard and safe way to authorize external tools.

                  Yes! We encourage it. The AI gives you a fantastic, optimized starting point, but you can always tweak the titles, descriptions, and keywords directly in our interface before you export or update them.

                  Your API keys and WordPress connections are stored in your own private data space in our database. The images and content you process are sent to the Gemini API for generation but are not stored by MetaMagic.

                  Our Meta Description tool for WordPress is currently optimized to work with the "All in One SEO" (AIOSEO) plugin, as it's one of the most popular. Support for other plugins like Yoast or Rank Math may be added in the future.

                  There are no limits imposed by MetaMagic. You can process as many items as you like. The only constraint will be the rate limits and quotas on your own Gemini API key, which are generally very generous for most use cases.
