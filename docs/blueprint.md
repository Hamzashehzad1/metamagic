## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#9D4EDD), symbolizing creativity and innovation, balanced with sophistication. 
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F3). It provides a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the content and supports a clean design.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFAA00), positioned as an accent color that grabs attention for important UI elements like CTAs.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, conveying a tech-forward feel, combined with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, providing excellent readability.
- Use modern, minimalist icons, using filled icons for primary actions, and outline icons for secondary ones.
- Maintain a minimal, clean, responsive design, similar to metadatagen.com, with ample whitespace, bold headings, and a card-based layout.
- Use subtle, modern animations for image uploads, metadata extraction, and copy actions to enhance user experience.
